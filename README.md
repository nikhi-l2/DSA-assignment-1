To : Develop the Inventory System for a Grocery  Store
OVERVIEW
This project implements an Inventory System for a Grocery Store using C++ with array-based data structures. It supports basic inventory operations like insertion, deletion, searching by ID or name, efficient storage using sparse representation for rarely restocked products, and organizes price and quantity data in both row-major and column-major order.
